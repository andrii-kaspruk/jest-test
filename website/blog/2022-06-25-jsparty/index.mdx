  <i>Jest Preview discussion stars at 38:15</i>
</small>

I had a chance to talk with [Nick Nisi](https://twitter.com/nicknisi) about [Jest Preview](https://github.com/nvh95/jest-preview) on [JS Party Podcast](https://changelog.com/jsparty). In this episode, Nick shared his experience attending [JSNation](https://jsnation.com) and [React Summit](https://reactsummit.com) in Amsterdam. Our discussion about Jest Preview starts at [**38:15**](https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/jsparty/231/js-party-231.mp3#t=2295). I briefly introduced what Jest Preview is and what problems it is trying to solve. I also shared about Best Practice to use [Jest Preview](https://github.com/nvh95/jest-preview) when you write tests, and how it can boost your productivity by **300%**. Finally, I explained how the library works under the hood (hint: it's very simple).

[I hope you enjoy this episode.](https://changelog.com/jsparty/231)
